    <h1>About it</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines computer science, engineering, and technology to design, build, and operate robots. 
        Robots are mechanical or virtual devices programmed to perform tasks autonomously or under human control.
         They can range from simple machines with predefined movements to highly 
        advanced systems capable of complex interactions with their environment.</p>
